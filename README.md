<h1>MILESTONE 3 - CODE INSTITUTE</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
A web application created in Python and Flask. 
View website on <a href="https://milestone3-data-centric.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>
A recipe database where viewers can search and view recipes. 
Users can also add, edit or delete their own recipes.
<h2>UX</h2>
This website was created with the intention to store and share recipes with other users, in a simple uncluttered layout, to make it easy to navigate. The user can choose a specific recipe from the list where more details about the recipe will be displayed, such as: category (appetizers, entrees and desserts), ingredients, cooking method, servings, preparation time and difficulty level. This page also allows the user to delete or edit the recipe. Within the navbar the user has access to all recipes. There's also a link that brings to a form to add a new recipe.
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>I would like to search and view recipes by keywords.</li>
<li>To add my own recipes into the database.</li>
<li>Be able to edit and delete my own recipes.</li>
<li>I like that my own recipes are protected and are only able to be edited or deleted by myself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>reate new recipes - recipe name, category, level of difficulty, servings, preparation time, method, ingredients.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>ead recipes</li>
<li><strong>U</strong>pdate recipes</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>elete recipes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features left to implement</h2>
<h4>User authentication</h4>
As it is any user can update and delete recipes, which could lead to the recipe information being amended/deleted maliciously. In order to amend this I would like to have implemented a user authentication system that would mean only the original author of the recipe has the power to edit or remove it.

<h2>Testing</h2>
All the CRUD actions were tested and are working as it should.   
The responsiveness was tested on every page. 
Every link was tested and works properly. 
All forms handle empty input fields.
<h2>Deployment</h2>
Deployment and source control was carried out via GitHub and Heroku. The following steps were taken to deploy the website:
<ul>
<li>Database was created in MongoDB Atlas</li>
<li>Project workspace was created in GitPod. In this workspace: Flask was installed - pip3 install flask</li>
<li>Setup app.py file and imported flask and os - from flask import Flask. import os</li>
<li>Created an instance of flask - app = flask(__name__)</li>
<li>Inside the app run() function set the host, ip and debug=true</li>
<li>Create a new Heroku App - unique name and EU Server</li>
<li>In GitPod login to Heroku through CLI to confirm existance of app. CLI: heroku login</li> 
<li>gitpod /workspace/M3-CI-DCD $ heroku login -i</li>
<li>heroku: Enter your login credentials</li>
<li>Email: roxana.hefferon@gmail.com</li>
<li>Password: **********</li>
<li>CLI: heroku apps</li>
<li>Create a git repository in GitPod. CLI: git init. CLI: git add . CLI: git commit -m "Initial Commit"</li>
<li>Connect GitPod to Heroku. Use code found on Heroku. CLI - $heroku git remote -a</li>
<li>Create requirements.txt file - CLI: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</li>
<li>Create Procfile - echo web:python app.py>Procfile</li>
<li>Add and Commit to Git Repository</li>
<li>Push to Heroku using code supplied by Heroku.</li>
<li>CLI - heroku ps:scale web=1 Command to tell Heroku to run the app</li>
<li>Log in to Heroku to add config variables including IP, Port, Mongo_DB and Mongo_URI</li> 
<ul><li>Set Config Vars adding IP and PORT on Heroku app settings</li>
<li>IP 0.0.0.0 - PORT 5000</li></ul>
<h5>Create a new git repository</h5>
<p>Initialize a git repository in a new or existing directory</p>
<p>$ cd my-project/</p>
<p>$ git init</p>
<p>$ heroku git:remote -a data-centric-m3-ci</p>
<h5>Deploy your application</h5>
<p>Commit your code to the repository and deploy it to Heroku using Git</p>
<p>$ git add .</p>
<p>$ git commit -am "make it better"</p>
<p>$ git push heroku master</p>
<h5>Existing Git repository<h5>
<p>For existing repositories, simply add the heroku remote</p>
